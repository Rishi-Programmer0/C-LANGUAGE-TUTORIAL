  <h1>Hello,I will teach you C language here</h1>
    <p>C language is the best language to learn as beginner</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Basic Formate</h3>
    <br>
      <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br><br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
        <br>
        <b>There should be symbol of < and > before and after stdio.h</b>
          
      </p>
        <h5>stdio.h is a library function.It allows us to use many functions like-</h5>
        <p>
          <b>
           printf<br>
           scanf<br>
           int<br>
           char<br>
           float<br>
          </b>
        </p>
        <h4>There are some lopps also in C languages to make code in less time.There name are-</h4>
        <p>
          <b>
          do while loop<br>
          while loop<br>
          for loop<br>
          </b>
        </p>
        <h5>For now lets only disscus about functions.</h5>
        <h2><b>Printf</b>-As is names says it print anything we want.Way to write it is like this-<br></h2>
        <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          printf("Anything you like");
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
        <h2><b>Scanf</b>-It is used to ask something from user.Way to write it is like this-<br></h2>
          <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          int a;<br>
          printf("Write a number:");
          <br>
          scanf("%d",&a);
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
            <br>"a" is integer.
            <br>
            <b>
            %d is used to show integer<br>
            %f is used to show float<br>
            %s is uesd to show many character<br>
            %c is used to show one character<br>
            </b>
            <h2><b>Int</b>-It is the full form of integer.Way to write it is like this-<br></h2>
        
            <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          int a;
          <br>
          printf("Write a number:");
          <br>
          scanf("%d",&a);
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
              <br>";" is used to terminate a code.You can think it as full stop also.<br>
              
              <h2><b>Char</b>-It is full form of character.Way to write it is like this-<br></h2>
              <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          char a;
          <br>
          printf("Type your name:");
          <br>
          scanf("%s",&a);
          <br>
          printf("Your name is %s",a);
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
                <br>
                <b><em>same like the above %c is also used.</em></b>
                <br> <p>#include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          char a;
          <br>
          printf("Type a letter:");
          <br>
          scanf("%c",&a);
          <br>
          printf("You have typed %c",a);
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
                  <br>
                  In both above case "char" is used but their recognition is different.In first it is "%s" and in second "%c" is used.
                  You can also see that in the first case I have typed "Type your name" whereas in second I have typed "Type a letter".This is the the difference.
                  <br>
                  <p>One more thing here I want to tell you that you see I have written %s and %c in the printf functions and when you run the code it will show the same thing that you have typed.It means that %s and %c can be also used in printf function.But do you know one thing %d and %f can be also used in printf function.</p>
                  <h2><b>Float</b>-It is nothing but decimals.Way to write it is like this-</h2>
                  <p>
                    #include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          float a;
          <br>
          printf("Write a number:");
          <br>
          scanf("%f",&a);
          <br>
          printf("The number you have typed is %f",a);
          <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}<br>
                  </p>
                  <h2>Now we are enough to code but do you know that how to add,subtract and do all atithimetic operations</h2>
                  <p>I think so you don't know so I will tell you.So first I will tell you that which arithimetic operations can be done by using which symbol.</p>
                  <p><b>+</b> is use to add<br><b>-</b> is use to subtract<br><b>*</b> is used to multiply<br><b>/</b> is use to divide<br><b>=</b> is use to assign a variable something<br><b>==</b> is use to compare two variables<br>
                    
                    <b><</b> is use to compare<br>
                    <b>></b> is use to compare<br>
                    Slowly after practicing you will understand every symbols.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Now I want that you make a programme using C language knowledge gain from this webpage that asks user to give two numbers one by one and then it will add.</b>Its output should look like this-</p>
                  
                  <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Download/Screenshot_20241024-134824_1.jpg">
                  <p>Sorry Sorry I have forgotten that where you would do this coding and make this programme.Don't worry <br>

                  <h2> <b>And Now we will talk about loops</b></h2>
                  
                  <h3>First "Do while loop"</h3>
                  <p> <b>So as it name says it is a loop which works until the requirment is fulfill.We write it as-</b></p>
                  <p>
                    #include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          int a;
          <br>
         
           
          printf("Write a number:");
          <br>
          scanf("%d",&a);
          <br>
          do{
            <br>
            printf("You are lucky\n");
            <br>
          }while(a<11);
            <br>
          return 0;
          <br>}
                    <p>Now make programme of yourself that uses <b><em>DO WHILE LOOP</em></b></p>
                    <p>Have you created it?
                      <input type="checkbox">
                    </p>
                    <h3>Now "While loop"</h3>
                    <p><b>It is also like "Do While Loop".But in this we don't write Do just write while like this-</b></p>
                    <p>
                         #include stdio.h<br>
        int main()
        <br>
        {<br>
          int a;
          <br>
         
           
          printf("Write a number:");
          <br>
          scanf("%d",&a);<br>
                        while(a>10)<br>{
                          <br>printf("You are lucky\n");<br>
                                   }
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>Now you know <b><em>WhILE LOOP</em></b> so I want that converts the previous programme maded with <b><em>DO WHILE LOOP</em></b> into while loop if you can.
                      <br>Can you?
                      <input type="checkbox">
                    </p>
                    <p>Hey! if you are here then all my information that I have till now is end and the webpage ends here but don't worry I will add more information as I study it.Till then Have a good DayðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
